## 🎯 EXISTING TESTS PERFORMANCE

### **Core Application Tests:**
- **Eligibility Engine**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Legal Data Validator**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Document Generator**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Document Template Engine**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Form Store**: ⚠️ Minor timing issues
- **Security Tests**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Integration Tests**: ✅ Most tests passing
- **Page Tests**: ✅ All tests passing

## 🔍 DETAILED ANALYSIS
